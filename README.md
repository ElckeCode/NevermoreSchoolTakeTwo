Nevermore School – C# Console Application

Overview:
This project is a C# console application developed as part of my Bachelor of Computing (Software Engineering) studies at Belgium Campus ITversity.

The application simulates a fictional school called *Nevermore School*, where students with special abilities are admitted into different houses. It demonstrates core object-oriented programming concepts, event handling, and exception management in C#.

Features:
- Admit students into the school  
- Prevent duplicate student names using a custom exception  
- Validate student age  
- Assign students to houses (Claws, Fangs, Shadows, Spirits)  
- Trigger unique abilities for each student type  
- Display all students grouped by house  
- Log actions using events  

Concepts Demonstrated:
- Inheritance and abstraction (`Student` base class and derived types)  
- Polymorphism (`UseAbility()` implementation per student type)  
- Custom exceptions (`DuplicateNameException`, `InvalidAgeException`)  
- Events and event handling  
- Collections and LINQ  
- Clean class-based design  

Technologies Used:
- C#  
- .NET (Console Application)  
- Visual Studio  

What I Learned:
- Designing systems using object-oriented principles  
- Creating and using custom exceptions  
- Implementing and subscribing to events  
- Structuring a project into logical, reusable classes  
- Writing readable and maintainable code  

How to Run:
1. Clone the repository  
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio  
3. Build and run the project  
4. View output in the console  



This project forms part of my academic portfolio for internship applications.
